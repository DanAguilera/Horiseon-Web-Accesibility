# Horiseon-Web-Accesibility

## This project I was given the opportunnity to add on to the following code and make it more "web accesible"

So as mentioned the motivation behind this project was making the webpage more accesible to others and adding alt elements to it. Thus, helping out the client by increasing their "search engine optimization". All in all I learned different types of alt attributes and their functions like the <nav> element and assigning it a role thereafter. Had a better understanding of assigning classes and ID's and how they connect to CSS. Implementing the first weeks knowledge was tough but reawarding.
